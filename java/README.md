**Note on SSL Certificate Verification**

You may experienc certificate validation issues when connecting to our API. The error message you see may look something like this: `Unable to find valid certification path to requested target`

Please do not panic! Our certificate is [perfectly valid](http://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html#hostname=api.africastalking.com), and the error you are seeing is quite common amongst Java clients connecting to secure websites.

Here is how to fix the issue:

- Download and compile InstallCert.java (you can find the code here).

- On the CMD prompt(Windows) or Terminal(*nix), run: `java InstallCert api.africastalking.com`

This will download a copy of our Certificate and create a file named `jssecacerts` in the current directory.

- You can now add our Certificate to your trusted store by copying the created `jssecacerts` file to the Java security directory under `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security`

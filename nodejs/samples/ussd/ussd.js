    Start a web server

    When Africasalking POSTs to your server, respond with text/plain starting with
    either CON or END.
    USSD is session driven. Every request we send you will contain a sessionId,
    and this will be maintained until that session is completed
    You will need to let the Mobile Service Provider know whether the session is complete or not.
    If the session is ongoing, please begin your response with CON. If this is the last response for
    that session, begin your response with END. If we get a HTTP error response (Code 40X) from your script,
    or a malformed response (does not begin with CON or END, we will terminate the USSD session gracefully.
    e.g. 
    CON What would you like to do?\n1. Check My Account\n2. Quit
